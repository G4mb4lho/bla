# bla
Strict PoE2 filter with my personal styling preferences.

Currency section yoinked from [NeverSink's basic filter](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-PoE2litefilter)
Uniques and Soul-cores sections yoinked from [cdr's filter](https://github.com/cdrg/cdr-poe2filter/tree/main)

The filter hides:
- Waystones below T15
- Small stacks of gold
- Low tier currencies (Transmute, Aug, Regal shard, Chance shard, Wisdom)
- Wisdom Scrolls
- White and Magic jewelry
- Non-expert non-jewelry gear
- Flasks except Ultimate Life/Mana ilvl 80+
- Charms
